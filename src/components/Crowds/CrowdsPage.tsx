            <p>
              Calling all build00rs! The very first, official Juicecrowd program
              is underway - where we support (and fund a little) early-stage
              projects looking to raise funds in the web3/blockchain space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Juicecrowd is an all-new program brought to you by the creators of
              Juicebox, designed to take up to 10 projects (per crowd), offering
              them support, funding and infrastructure to help you raise funds
              to achieve your goals in a crowdfunding format.
            </p>
            <p>
              This program is designed to take 10 existing projects (per crowd),
              offering further support, funding and infrastructure to raise
              funds in a crowdfunding format.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plus, we have an additional prize pool of 3 ETH up for grabs ðŸŽ‰
