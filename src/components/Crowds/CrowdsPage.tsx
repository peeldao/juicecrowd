              - helping creators launch and grow successful crowdfunding
              campaigns. We run things in crowds - like small cohorts. Each
              crowd will accept up to ten projects and offer them support,
              guidance, and infrastructure to raise funds in a crowdfunding
              format.
            </p>
            <p>
              Juicecrowd 01 (JC01) is our very first crowd. We&apos;re looking
              for early-stage projects in the web3/blockchain space that are
              actively raising funds. In addition to support and guidance for
              selected projects, we also have a{' '}
